# Introduction to HTML & CSS
Let's build a website.

## Setting up tools
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)

  Create a free personal account and download the desktop app for your computer. ([Windows](https://windows.github.com/) or [Mac OS X](https://mac.github.com/))

- [Atom](https://atom.io/)

  Download and install this text editor to be able to edit source code files.

## Fork this repository
On the GitHub page of the [cbas/html-css-intro](https://github.com/cbas/html-css-intro) repository, press the **Fork** button.

Forking creates your own copy of this code to set up your own website.

The fork will be available at: <https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/html-css-intro>

Any changes you make to your copy will not affect anyone else's not the original repository.

*Note: Forking is specific to the GitHub service and not part of the underlying Git source code manager. Git itself has a concept of branching which is similar but branches exist only within a copy of the repository.*

## Hack the code
Use Atom to edit the HTML and CSS files. In the GitHub app, right click on the repository bookmark, and choose "Open in Atom."

### Content authoring
The file `index.html` contains the page content in HTML format. Text, links, images, navigation, videos, widgets, etc.

*Tip: Start by writing the content as plain text. You can even use [Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/), just like this file.*

### Structuring the document
Use semantic HTML tags to describe the content semantically.

Semantic markup matter helps browsers and bots (i.e. search engines, social media) understand the site. It also makes it easier to style the page.

### Design and layout
With CSS the content can be styled.

## Publish your website
Commit & Push your changes to GitHub. Because they are on the `gh-pages` branch they will automatically be published on GitHub Pages.

Visit your page at: <https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/html-css-intro>

## Next Steps

### Change the URL path of your website
By renaming the repository or registering a unique domain name you can [publish the website at a custom URL](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/).
